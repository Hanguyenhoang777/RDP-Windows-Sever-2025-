  ‚ö†Ô∏èsome small notes:
  1.This machine can only be used for 6 hours.
  2.According to some of the times I tried, if you are not lucky, you will probably get banned from github (maybeü•≤)
  3.That YouTube link is from another channel, not my video.
  4.there is a limit to how much money you can use on github (probably, if you want more do it yourself)
  5(Remember, this is the most important. Without it, you won't be able to use VPS)
  REMEMBER DON'T FORGET TO DOWNLOAD THE TAILSCALE APP ON YOUR DEVICE, REMEMBER TO TURN IT ON AFTER SETTING UP THE VIRTUAL MACHINE
